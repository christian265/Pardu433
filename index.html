<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stay safe</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you're traveling in a foreign country, safety should always be your number one priority. India is a beautiful country with a rich history and culture, but it can also be dangerous if you're not careful.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are a few things you can do to stay safe while you're in India: always stay aware of your surroundings, don't carry too much cash with you, and avoid walking around at night. If you're going to be out late, take a taxi or an Uber instead of walking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And if you do happen to get lost, don't panic! Just find a busy area with lots of people and ask for help. People in India are generally very friendly and will be happy to assist you.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dress conservatively</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When traveling in India, it's important to dress conservatively. That doesn't mean you have to cover up from head to toe, but you should avoid wearing anything too revealing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, many women choose to wear a sari, which is a traditional Indian dress that covers most of your body. If you're not comfortable wearing a sari, there are plenty of other options, like pants and long-sleeved shirts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just be sure to avoid tight clothing or anything that shows too much skin. You'll want to respect the local culture and dress in a way that's appropriate for the country you're visiting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Have fun! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_India">India is an amazing country with an incredible culture</a>, and it's guaranteed to be an adventure you'll never forget!</p>
